</p>
<br>
<h5>4. PAYMENT</h5>
<br>
Key definitions
<br>
<p>
“Payment method”: means a payment method that you have added to your Grab Account, such as credit card, debit card or Braintree. 
</p>
 <br>
 <p>
“Grab fees”: means the amounts that a Grabber is willing to pay to take a Waste by using the Service, under specific terms (“GrabTerms”). Each Grabber can bid a Grab fee and has no restrain whatsoever on the amount he proposes. Only the Grabber, and not Grab, is responsible for the amount he, she or it proposes as Grab fee. The Grabber may in his, her or its sole discretion decide to include in his, her or its amount other fees, namely (i) a distance fee or any other fee permitted on the Grab plateform; (ii) Taxes that the Grabber determines that he, she or it has to collect. 
</p> 
<br>
<p>
“User fees”:  means the amount that Grab charges the User for the use of the Service, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Grab fees. The User fees will be displayed to the User when the User is asked whether to accept or reject the submission.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Total fees User”: means collectively the Grab fees, User fees and taxes. The User sees only the Total fees User when he, she or it receives the submission for a Grab, which enables he, she or it to compare the amount at the same level. Total fees User are automatically charged by the preferred Payment method when the Grab is accepted. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Grabber fees”: means the fee that Grab charge a Grabber for the use of the Service, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Grab fees, with a minimum charge on each transaction. The Grabber fees will be displayed to the Grabber when the Grabber is asked whether to send a submission, but the Grabber fees will be charged when the submission is accepted by the User and becomes a Grab. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Service fees”: means collectively the User fees and Grabber fees. </p> 
<br>
<p>
You understand that your use of the Services may result in the above defined Total fees for User. After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Grab will facilitate your payment of the applicable Grab Fee on behalf of the Grabber, as Grabber’s limited payment collection agent. After you received services or goods through your use of the Service, you must confirm it to Grab through the plateform because it is a condition for payment to the Grabber. A period of 24 hours is left after the Grab so you can confirm or not the Grab, but without any action, the services or goods will be deemed to be made. Payment of the Grab Fee in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Grabber. Total fees for User will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
All charges are due immediately when the User accepts the Total fees for User and payment will be facilitated by Grab using the Payment method, after which Grab will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Grab may, as Grabber's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As between you and Grab, Grab reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise User fees for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Grab's sole discretion, provided that any such changes shall not apply any transaction already accepted. Grab may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Total fees for User applied to you. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Grabber for the services or goods provided.  Grab does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Grabber. Any representation by Grab (on Grab's website, in the Application, or in Grab's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Grab provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Grabber. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Grabber who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Grabber.
</p>
<br>
REFUND POLICY
<br>
<br>
<p>
You understand that when using the Services, a third party is involved and has a deal with you. 
You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Grabber at any time prior such Grabber's arrival in the contract. This contract clearly states a specific date and timeframe; this timeframe is the limit to cancel without charges. These timeframes are: Morning (7:00 to 12:00), Afternoon (12:00 to 17:00) and Evening (17:00 to 22:00). The User can therefore cancel a Grab without cancellation fee prior to the timeframe set out in the contract. 
The User can also request changes in its contract before the Grabber arrivals, but this remains to the Grabber's discretion to accept or not such changes.
</p><br>
<p>When a User wants to cancel a Grab and cancellation fees shall be charged, a message indicating the cancellation fee will be sent to inform him, her or it, before going further. When the cancellation is enabled by the user, Total fees User will be refund.  . </p> 
<br>
<p>
Total fees User paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise expressly determined in writing by Grab. </p>
<br>
<p>
You retain the right to request lower or to remove any Grab fees from a Grabber for services or goods received by you from such Grabber. Grab will solely respond accordingly to any request from you or a Grabber to modify the Grab fees for a particular service or good if both parties agree in writing to do so as provided in the plateform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service fees shall remain fully applicable.
</p><br>

<p>In the case you did not receive the requested services or goods in your contract, Grab will refund you the Total fees for User. As compensation, the Grab promise is to help you during the reactivation of your Grab so you’ll quickly find another Grabber. Grab will also give you a credit on your next bill. </p>
