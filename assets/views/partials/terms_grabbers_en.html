<h5>3. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES</h5>
<br>
USER ACCOUNTS.
<br>
<br>
<p>

If you are doing business under your personal name, you must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration may require you to submit to Grab certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or Grab's termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Grab in writing, you may only possess one Account.</p>
<br>
USER REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT.
<br><br>
<p>
You may not authorize third parties to use your Account. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes (e.g., no transport of unlawful or hazardous materials). You will not in your use of the Services cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the user, Grabber or any other party. In certain instances you may be asked to provide proof of identity to access or use the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of the Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When creating your account, the Service will ask you your availability, the geographical area and the preferred type of Waste you want to collect. Each time a user is asking for a grab that matches your characteristics, you will receive a notification to which you must answer by submitting an offer or refusing. Since you create a Grabber Account, you agree to meet the demand; from 3 refusals or non-responses within 24 hours you will receive a warning, and when it comes to 5 refusals or non-responses in 24 hours, your account will be temporarily disabled and Grab reserves itself the right to permanently close your Account.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Furthermore, Grab reserves itself the right to permanently close your Account if you are in default to respect any of your obligations under these Terms.
</p>
<br>
PROMOTIONAL CODES.
<br>
<br>
<p>
Grab may, in Grab's sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Grabber's services, subject to any additional terms that Grab establishes on a per promotional code basis ("Promo Codes"). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Grab; (iii) may be disabled by Grab at any time for any reason without liability to Grab; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Grab establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Grab reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that Grab determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.</p>
<br>
GRABBER PROVIDED CONTENT.
<br>
<br>
<p>
Grab may, in Grab sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to Grab through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content, including pictures, and information, whether nominal or non-nominal, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions ("Grabber Content"). Any Grabber Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing Grabber Content to Grab, you grant Grab a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such Grabber Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Grab's business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Grabber Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Grab the license to the Grabber Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the Grabber Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such Grabber Content nor Grab's use of the Grabber Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
<br>
<p>
You agree to not provide Grabber Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Grab in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. Grab may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove Grabber Content, at Grab's sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.</p>
<br>
NETWORK ACCESS AND DEVICES.
<br>
<br>
<p>
You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto.

In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.
</p>
<br>
<h5>4. PAYMENT</h5>
<br>
Key definitions
<br>
<p>
“Payment method”: means a payment method that you have added to your Grab Account, such as credit card, debit card or Braintree.   
</p>
 <br>
 <p>
“Grab fees”: means the amounts that a Grabber is willing to pay to take a Waste by using the Service under the specific terms agreed upon through the Service (“Grab Terms”). Each Grabber can bid a Grab fee and has no restrain whatsoever on the amount he proposes. Only the Grabber, and not Grab, is responsible for his, her or its Grab fee. The Grabber may in his, her or its sole discretion decide to include in his, her or its amount other fees, namely: (i) a distance fee or any other fee permitted on the Grab platform; (ii) Taxes that the Grabber determines that he, she or it has to collect. 
</p> 
<br>
<p>
“User fees”:  means the amount that Grab charge the User for the use of the Service, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Grab fees. The User fees will be displayed to the User when the User is asked whether to accept or reject the submission. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Total fees for User”: means collectively the Grab fees, User fees and taxes. The User sees only the Total fees User when he, she or it receives the submission for a Grab, which enables he, she or it to compare the amount at the same level. Total fees User are automatically charged by the preferred Payment method when the Grab is accepted. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 “Grabber fees”: means the fee that Grab charge a Grabber for the use of the Service, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Grab fees, with a minimum charge on each transaction. The Grabber fees will be displayed to the Grabber when the Grabber is asked whether to send a submission, but the Grabber fees will be charged when the submission is accepted by the User and becomes a Grab.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Service fees”: means collectively the User fees and Grabber fees. </p> 
<br>
<p>
You understand that use of the Services may result in Grabber Fees payable by you to Grab and a Grab Fee payable to you solely by the User for the services or goods you provided to the user. After you have provided services or goods through your use of the Service, confirmed by the User, and confirmed to Grab through the Application that you have dropped off the grab at the agreed place in the Grab Terms, Grab will facilitate your receipt of payment of the applicable Grab fees on behalf of the user, as your limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Grab Fees in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly to you by the user. Grab Fees will be inclusive of applicable taxes, less Grabber fees, where required by law.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
Payments will be made every two (2) weeks by your preferred Payment method at the dates indicated by Grab on its website, after which Grab will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Grab may, as your limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As between you and Grab, Grab reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Grabber fees for any or all services or goods provided through the use of the Services at any time in Grab's sole discretion provided that any such changes shall not apply any transaction already accepted. Grab may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Grabbers Fees applied to you.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
This payment structure is intended to fully compensate you for the services or goods you have provided to the user.  Grab does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to you. Any representation by Grab (on Grab's website, in the Application, or in Grab's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you receive for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Grab provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to you. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Grabber who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have provided services or goods through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your user.
</p>
<br>
REFUND POLICY
<br>
<br>
<p>
You understand that when using the Services, a third party is involved and has a deal with you. 
As a Grabber, you can remove your submission at any time, but once it is accepted by a User, it becomes an official Grab and can’t be canceled without cancellation fees. 
The Grabber can also request changes in its contract before scheduled Grab, but this remains to the User's discretion to accept or not such changes.
</p><br>
<p>When the cancellation is enabled by the Grabber, Grabber fees will be refund. </p> 
<br>
<p>

Grabber fees paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise expressly determined in writing by Grab. </p>
<br>
<p>
You retain the right to request higher Grab fees from a User for services or goods provided by you to such User at the time you provide such services or goods. Grab will solely respond accordingly to any request from you or the User to modify the Grab fees for a particular service or good if both parties agree to do so as provided in the plateform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service fees shall remain fully applicable.
</p><br>
<h5>
5. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.</h5>
<br>

GRAB SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM ANY USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF GRAB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. GRAB SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF: (i) YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; OR (ii) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND ANY USER, EVEN IF GRAB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

</p><br>
<p>

</p><br>

<br>
<br>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold GRAB and its officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees), arising out of or in connection with: (i) your use of the Services or services or goods obtained through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms; (iii) GRAB’s use of your Grabber Content; or (iv) your violation of the rights of any third party, including any user or other Grabbers.
</p><br><br>
<h5>6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h5>
<br>
ARBITRATION.
<br><br>
<p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and GRAB, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and GRAB are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and GRAB otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.
</p><br>
ARBITRATION RULES AND GOVERNING LAW.
<br><br>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
</p><br>
ARBITRATION PROCESS.
<br><br>
<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
</p><br>
ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE.
<br><br>
<p>Unless you and Grab otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Grab submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.<p>
<br>
ARBITRATOR'S DECISION.
<br><br>
<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Grab will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Grab may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if Grab prevail in arbitration.</p>
<br>
FEES.
<br><br>
<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Grab will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
</p>
<br>
CHANGES.
<br><br>
<p>
Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Grab changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Grab written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Grab head office, 7240, rue waverly, suite 103, Montreal (Quebec) H2R 2Y8, or by email from the email address associated with your Account to: change-dr@we-grab-it.com, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last update" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Grab in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
</p>
<br>
<h5>7. OTHER PROVISIONS</h5>
<br>

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. Grab's failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Grab in writing.
